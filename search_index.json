Syllabus Questions? 1.2 Statistical and Critical Thinking Statistics: The science of planning studies and experiments, obtaining data, and then organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, interpreting, and drawing conclusions based on the data. What does statistics do? Data: Collections of observations, such as measurements, genders, or survey responses Population: The complete collection of all measurements or data that are being considered. Typically, a population is the complete collection of data that we would like to make inferences about. Census:The collection of data from every member of a population Sample: A subcollection of members selected from a population Survey: The study of samples 1.3 Example 1 The student senate at a university with 15,000 students is interested in the proportion of students who favor a change in the grading system to allow for plus and minus grades (e.g. B+, B, B-, rather than just B). Two hundred students are interviewed to determine their attitude toward this proposed change. What is the population of interest? What group of students constitutes the sample in this problem? Population: 15,000 students at that University Sample: 200 students are interviewed at that University 1.4 Example 2 In the journal article “Residential Carbon Monoxide Detector Failure Rates in the United States”, it was stated that there are 38 million carbon monoxide detectors installed in the United States. When 30 of them were randomly selected and tested, it was found that 12 of them failed to provide an alarm in hazardous carbon monoxide conditions. Population: All 38 million carbon monoxide detectors in the United States Sample: The 30 carbon monoxide detectors that were selected and tested 1.5 Statistical Thinking Procedure: Prepare (the goal of the study, collecting data, what are the data about, cleaning the data) Analyze (graph the data, explore the data, apply more statistical methods) Conclude (what conclusion can you make? Do they have statistical/pratical significant?). Section of Plane Bullet holes per square foot Engine 1.11 Fuselage 1.73 Fuel System 1.55 Rest of the plane 1.8 Source: How not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking- by Jordan Ellenberg Statistical significance is achieved in a study when we get a result that is very unlikely to occur by chance. 1.6 Types of Data Parameter: a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population. (population mean, standard deviation, variance, etc) Statistic: a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a sample. (Sample mean, standard deviation, variance, etc) Categorical (or qualitative or attribute) data: consists of names or labels (representing categories). Quantitative (or numerical) data: consists of numbers representing counts or measurements. Discrete data: result when the number of possible values is either a finite number or a countable number Continuous (numerical) data: result from infinitely many possible values that correspond to some continuous scale that covers a range of values without gaps, interruptions, or jumps. 1.7 Example 3 Classify each of the following attributes as either categorical or numerical. For those that are numerical, determine whether they are discrete or continuous the appraised value of homes in Frisco the color of cars in the teacher’s lot the number of calculators owned by students at your school the zip code of an individual the amount of time it takes students to drive to school The actual weight of a 1-lb can Your height Your Weight Amount of rain drops in Antelope Valley 1.8 Levels of Measurement Nominal level of measurement: characterized by data that consist of names, labels, or categories only, and the data cannot be arranged in some order (such as low to high). Survey responses of yes, no, and undecided Ordinal level of measurement: involves data that can be arranged in some order, but differences (obtained by subtraction) between data values either cannot be determined or are meaningless. Course grades A, B, C, D, or F Interval level of measurement: involves data that can be arranged in order, and the differences between data values can be found and are meaningful. However, there is no natural zero starting point at which none of the quantity is present. Example: Years 1000, 2000, 1776, and 1492 Ratio level of measurement: data can be arranged in order, differences can be found and are meaningful, and there is a natural zero starting point (where zero indicates that none of the quantity is present). Differences and ratios are both meaningful. Example: Class times of 50 minutes and 100 minutes 1.9 Summary - Levels of Measurement Nominal: categories only Ordinal: categories with some order Interval: differences but no natural zero point Ratio: differences and a natural zero point 1.10 Big Data and Data Science Learn more about computer science and statistical programming (Python, SAS, R, STATA). Using a calculator is not enough. 1.11 How do we gather data? Census Surveys Opinion polls Interviews Studies Observational Retrospective (past) Prospective (future) Experiments 1.12 How good a poll would be? [Daily Show-Poll Bearers] 1.13 Basics of Collecting Data Observational study: observing and measuring specific characteristics without attempting to modify the subjects being studied. Experiment: apply some treatment and then observe its effects on the subjects (subjects in experiments are called experimental units) 1.14 Observational Study: Survey Sample: A part of the population that we actually examine in order to gather information. We Use sample to generalize to population. 1.15 Sampling Methods: Let’s take a look at a simple dataset: ## Students Sex class GPA Honors ## 1 Alice F Fr 3.80 Yes ## 2 Brad M Fr 2.60 Yes ## 3 Caleb M Fr 2.25 No ## 4 Daisy F Fr 2.10 No ## 5 Faye F Fr 2.00 No ## 6 Eva F Fr 1.80 No ## 7 Georg M Fr 1.40 No ## 8 Andrea F So 4.00 Yes ## 9 Betsy F So 4.00 Yes ## 10 Chris M So 4.00 Yes ## 11 Dylan M So 3.50 Yes ## 12 Felipe M So 3.00 No ## 13 Eric M So 2.10 No ## 14 Gabriel M So 1.98 No ## 15 Adam M Jr 3.98 Yes ## 16 Brittany F Jr 3.90 No ## 17 Cassie F Jr 3.75 Yes ## 18 Derek M Jr 3.10 Yes ## 19 Faith F Jr 2.50 Yes ## 20 Eliott M Jr 1.90 No ## 21 Garth M Jr 1.10 No ## 22 Angela F Sr 4.00 Yes ## 23 Bob M Sr 3.80 Yes ## 24 Carl M Sr 3.10 No ## 25 Diana F Sr 2.90 No ## 26 Frank M Sr 2.00 No ## 27 Ed M Sr 1.50 No ## 28 Grace F Sr 1.40 No The population mean GPA is \\(\\mu=2.766\\) 1.16 Sampling Methods: Simple Random Sample Simple Random Sample (SRS): consist of n individuals from the population chosen in such a way that every individual has an equal chance of being selected and every set of n individuals has an equal chance of being selected Let’s use SRS to take 7 samples: ## Students Sex class GPA Honors ## 10 Chris M So 4.0 Yes ## 2 Brad M Fr 2.6 Yes ## 16 Brittany F Jr 3.9 No ## 20 Eliott M Jr 1.9 No ## 21 Garth M Jr 1.1 No ## 23 Bob M Sr 3.8 Yes ## 13 Eric M So 2.1 No The sample mean using SRS, which is \\(\\bar{x}_{srs}=\\) 2.7714286 Strengths The selection of one element does not affect the selection of others. Each possible sample, of a given size, has an equal chance of being selected. Simple random samples tend to be good representations of the population. Requires little knowledge of the population. Weaknesses If there are small subgroups within the population, a SRS may not give an accurate representation of that subgroup. In fact, it may not include it at all! This is especially true if the sample size is small. If the population is large and widely dispersed, it can be costly (both in time and money) to collect the data. 1.17 Samping Methods: Systematic Sampling In a systematic sample, the members of the population are put in a row. Then 1 out of every k members are selected. The starting point is randomly chosen from the first k elements and then elements are sampled at the same location in each of the subsequent segments of size k. The key word is every… ## [1] 4 So, we will start with element 4, which is Daisy and choose every 4th element after that for our sample. ## Students Sex class GPA Honors ## 4 Daisy F Fr 2.1 No ## 8 Andrea F So 4.0 Yes ## 12 Felipe M So 3.0 No ## 16 Brittany F Jr 3.9 No ## 20 Eliott M Jr 1.9 No ## 24 Carl M Sr 3.1 No ## 28 Grace F Sr 1.4 No The mean GPA of the systematic sample, the sample mean, \\(\\bar{x}_{sys}\\), is 2.7714286. Strengths Assures an even, random sampling of the population. When the population is an ordered list, a systematic sample gives a better representation of the population than a SRS. Can be used in situations where a SRS is difficult or impossible. It is especially useful when the population that you are studying is arranged in time. Weaknesses Not every combination has an equal chance of being selected. Many combinations will never be selected using a systematic sample! Large Variance. Formulas are really complicated 1.18 Sampling Methods: Stratified random sample Stratified Sampling In a stratified sample, the population must first be separated into homogeneous groups, or strata. Each element only belongs to one stratum and the stratum consist of elements that are alike in some way. A simple random sample is then drawn from each stratum, which is combined to make the stratified sample. ## Students Sex class GPA Honors ## 1 Alice F Fr 3.80 Yes ## 2 Brad M Fr 2.60 Yes ## 8 Andrea F So 4.00 Yes ## 9 Betsy F So 4.00 Yes ## 10 Chris M So 4.00 Yes ## 11 Dylan M So 3.50 Yes ## 15 Adam M Jr 3.98 Yes ## 17 Cassie F Jr 3.75 Yes ## 18 Derek M Jr 3.10 Yes ## 19 Faith F Jr 2.50 Yes ## 22 Angela F Sr 4.00 Yes ## 23 Bob M Sr 3.80 Yes we take a SRS of size 3 from the Honors students: ## Students Sex class GPA Honors ## 18 Derek M Jr 3.1 Yes ## 19 Faith F Jr 2.5 Yes ## 23 Bob M Sr 3.8 Yes The sample mean for the stratified sample, \\(\\bar{x}_{strat}=\\) 3.1333333 Strengths: Representative of the population, because elements from all strata are included in the sample. Ensures that specific groups are represented, sometimes even proportionally, in the sample. Since each stratified sample will be distributed similarly, the amount of variability between samples is decreased. Allows comparisons to be made between strata, if necessary. For example, a stratified sample allows you to easily compare the mean GPA of Honors students to the mean GPA of non-Honors students. Weaknesses Requires prior knowledge of the population. You have to know something about the population to be able to split into strata! 1.19 Sampling Methods: Cluster Sampling Cluster Sampling Cluster sampling is a sampling method used when natural groups are evident in the population. The clusters should all be similar each other: each cluster should be a small scale representation of the population. To take a cluster sample, a random sample of the clusters is chosen. All the elements of the randomly chosen clusters make up the sample. Note: There are a couple of differences between stratified and cluster sampling. In a stratified sample, the differences between stratum are high while the differences within strata are low. In a cluster sample, the differences between clusters are low while the differences within clusters are high. In a stratified sample, a simple random sample is chosen from each stratum. So, all of the stratum are represented, but not all of the elements in each stratum are in the sample . In a cluster sample, a simple random sample of clusters is chosen. So, not all of the clusters are represented, but all elements from the chosen clusters are in the sample. Let’s take a cluster sample using the grade level (freshmen, sophomore, junior, senior) of FakeSchool as the clusters. Let’s take a random sample of 2 of them. ## Students Sex class GPA Honors ## 15 Adam M Jr 3.98 Yes ## 16 Brittany F Jr 3.90 No ## 17 Cassie F Jr 3.75 Yes ## 18 Derek M Jr 3.10 Yes ## 19 Faith F Jr 2.50 Yes ## 20 Eliott M Jr 1.90 No ## 21 Garth M Jr 1.10 No ## 22 Angela F Sr 4.00 Yes ## 23 Bob M Sr 3.80 Yes ## 24 Carl M Sr 3.10 No ## 25 Diana F Sr 2.90 No ## 26 Frank M Sr 2.00 No ## 27 Ed M Sr 1.50 No ## 28 Grace F Sr 1.40 No The sample mean for the clustered sample, \\(\\bar{x}_{clust}\\), is 2.7807143. Strengths: Makes it possible to sample if there is no list of the entire population, but there is a list of subpopulations. For example, there is not a list of all church members in the United States. However, there is a list of churches that you could sample and then acquire the members list from each of the selected churches. Weaknesses: Not always representative of the population. Elements within clusters tend to be similar to one another based on some characteristic(s). This can lead to over-representation or under-representation of those characteristics in the sample. 1.20 Sampling Methods: Convenience sampling Convenience sampling: Ask people who are easy to ask, friendly, or interviewer is comfortable asking. Produces bias results (Don’t use). 1.21 Summary of Sampling Methods Simple Random Sample: consists of n individuals from the population chosen in such a way that every individual has an equal chance of being selected and every set of n individuals has an equal chance of being selected. Stratified random sample: population is divided into homogeneous groups called strata, then SRS’s are pulled from each strata Systematic random sample: select sample by following a systematic approach (e.g. every 50th), after randomly selecting where to begin Cluster sample: based upon location; randomly pick a location, then sample ALL in that location Multistage Sampling: Collect data by using some combination of the basic sampling methods. In a multistage sample design, pollsters select a sample in different stages, and each stage might use different methods of sampling. (will not be on test) Convience Sampling: Bad sampling method. 1.22 Example 4 Identify the sampling design: Modern Managed Hospitals (MMH) is a national for-profit chain of hospitals. Management wants to survey patients discharged this past year to obtain patient satisfaction profiles. They wish to use a sample of such patients. Several sampling techniques are described below. Categorize each as simple random, stratified, systematic, cluster, or convenience sample. Obtain a list of patients discharged from all MMH facilities. Divide the patients according to length of hospital stay (3 days or less, 3 - 7 days, 8 -14 days, more than 14 days). Draw simple random samples from each group. Obtain lists of patients discharged from all MMH facilities. Number these patients, and then use a random number table to obtain the sample. Randomly select some MMH facilities from each of five geographic regions, and then survey all of these hospitals’ discharge lists. At the beginning of the year, instruct each MMH facility to survey every 500th patient discharged. Instruct each MMH facility to survey 10 discharged patients this week and send in the results. Identify the sampling design: The Educational Testing Service (ETS) needed a sample of colleges. ETS first divided all colleges into groups of similar types (small public, small private, etc.) Then they randomly selected 3 colleges from each group. A county commissioner wants to survey people in her district to determine their opinions on a particular law up for adoption. She decides to randomly select blocks in her district and then survey all who live on those blocks. A local restaurant manager wants to survey customers about the service they receive. Each night the manager randomly chooses a number between 1 &amp; 10. He then gives a survey to that customer and to every 10th customer after that, to fill out before they leave. 1.23 Bias bias: A systematic error in measuring the estimate ; favors certain outcomes; has to do with center of sampling distributions; if centered over true parameter then considered unbiased. sources of bias in surveys: things that can cause bias in your sample voluntary response: people choose to respond; usually only people with very strong opinions respond convenience sampling: ask people who are easy to ask, friendly, or interviewer is comfortable asking; produces bias results undercoverage: some groups of population are left out of the sampling process nonresponse: occurs when an individual chosen for the sample can’t be contacted or refuses to cooperate; telephone surveys 70% nonresponse response bias: occurs when the behavior of respondent or interviewer causes bias in the sample; wrong/false answers wording of the questions: wording can influence the answers that are given; leading questions; connotation of words; use of “big” words or technical words cannot do anything with bad data 1.24 Potential Pitfalls Misleading Conclusions Sample Data Reported Instead of Measured Loaded Questions Order of Questions Nonresponse Percentages 1.25 Experimental Design experiment: actively impose some treatment in order to observe the response "],

Definitions Lower class limits: The smallest numbers that can belong to each of the different classes Upper class limit: The largest numbers that can belong to each of the different classes Class boundaries: The numbers used to separate the classes, but without the gaps created by class limits Class midpoints: The values in the middle of the classes Each class midpoint can be found by adding the lower class limit to the upper class limit and dividing the sum by 2. Class width: The difference between two consecutive lower class limits in a frequency distribution. 2.2 Procedure for Constructing a Frequency Distribution Select the number of classes, usually between 5 and 20. Calculate the class width. (Will be given on test) Calculate the class width. (round up the number) \\[\\textrm{Class Width}\\approx\\frac{\\textrm{max data value-min data value}}{\\textrm{number of class}}\\] Choose the value for the first lower class limit by using either the minimum value or a convenient value below the minimum. Using the first lower class limit and class width, list the other lower class limits. List the lower class limits in a vertical column and then determine and enter the upper class limits. Take each individual data value and put a tally mark in the appropriate class. Add the tally marks to get the frequency. 2.3 Example Time(Seconds) Frquency 75-124 11 125-174 24 175-224 10 225-274 3 275-324 2 How do we get this table? Below is the dataset of McDonald’s Lunch Drive-Through Service Time from a sample: 2.4 Relative Frequency Distribution Relative Frequency Distribution or Percentage Frequency Distribution: Each class frequency is replaced by a relative frequency (or proportion) or a percentage \\[\\textrm{Relative Frequency for a class}=\\frac{\\textrm{frequency for a class}}{\\textrm{sum of all frequencies}}\\] Percentage Frequency: just convert the above to percent. The sum of the percentages in a relative frequency distribution must be very close to 100% (with a little wiggle room for rounding errors). 2.5 Cumulative Frequency Distribution Cumulative Frequency Distribution: The frequency for each class is the sum of the frequencies for that class and all previous classes. 2.6 Cumulative Relative Frequence Simply divide the cumulative frequency by the total frequency. If we plot the cumulative relative frequency, the plot is called the Ogive 2.7 Using Frequency Distributions to Understand Data We can roughly identify the distribution of a dataset using the frequency distribution. However, the more convinent way to do so is to use a historgram, which we will discuss later. 2.8 Gaps The presence of gaps can show that the data are from two or more different populations. However, the converse is not true, because data from different populations do not necessarily result in gaps. 2.9 What Do Gaps Tell Us? The table shown is a frequency distribution of the weights (grams) of randomly selected pennies. Pennies made before 1983 are 95% copper and 5% zinc. Pennies made after 1983 are 2.5% copper and 97.5% zinc. 2.10 Histogram Histogram: A graph consisting of bars of equal width drawn adjacent to each other (unless there are gaps in the data). The horizontal scale represents classes of quantitative data values, and the vertical scale represents frequencies. The heights of the bars correspond to frequency values. 2.11 Important Uses of a Histogram Visually displays the shape of the distribution of the data Shows the location of the center of the data Shows the spread of the data Identifies outliers 2.12 Example of A Histogram Relative Frequency Histogram: It has the same shape and horizontal scale as a histogram, but the vertical scale is marked with relative frequencies instead of actual frequencies. 2.13 Interpreting Histograms Explore the data by analyzing the histogram to see what can be learned about “CVDOT”: the Center of the data, the Variation, the shape of the Distribution, whether there are any Outliers, and Time. (if possible) 2.14 Common Distribution Shapes 2.15 Assessing Normality with Normal Quantile Plots (Q-Q plots) Criteria for Assessing Normality with a Normal Quantile Plot Normal Distribution: The pattern of the points in the normal quantile plot is reasonably close to a straight line, and the points do not show some systematic pattern that is not a straight-line pattern. Not a Normal Distribution: The population distribution is not normal if the normal quantile plot has either or both of these two conditions: The points do not lie reasonably close to a straight-line pattern. The points show some systematic pattern that is not a straight-line pattern. (going up and down around the line) 2.16 Examples of Q-Q plots Normal Distribution: The points are reasonably close to a straight-line pattern, and there is no other systematic pattern that is not a straight-line pattern. Not a Normal Distribution: The points do not lie reasonably close to a straight line. Not a Normal Distribution: The points show a systematic pattern that is not a straight-line pattern. 2.17 Dotplots A graph of quantitative data in which each data value is plotted as a point (or dot) above a horizontal scale of values. Dots representing equal values are stacked. Features of a Dotplot Displays the shape of distribution of data. It is usually possible to recreate the original list of data values. 2.18 Stemplots (You need to assign a key to read a stem plot) Represents quantitative data by separating each value into two parts: the stem (such as the leftmost digit) and the leaf (such as the rightmost digit). Features of a Stemplot Shows the shape of the distribution of the data. Retains the original data values. The sample data are sorted (arranged in order). 2.19 Bar Graph Shows the relative distribution of categorical data so that it is easier to compare the different categories. 2.20 Pareto Chart A Pareto chart is a bar graph for categorical data, with the added stipulation that the bars are arranged in descending order according to frequencies, so the bars decrease in height from left to right. Features of a Pareto Chart Shows the relative distribution of categorical data so that it is easier to compare the different categories. Draws attention to the more important categories. 2.21 Pie Charts A very common graph that depicts categorical data as slices of a circle, in which the size of each slice is proportional to the frequency count for the category; Shows the distribution of categorical data in a commonly used format. 2.22 Frequency Polygon A graph using line segments connected to points located directly above class midpoint values A frequency polygon is very similar to a histogram, but a frequency polygon uses line segments instead of bars. 2.23 Graphs That Deceive 2.24 Pictographs By using pictographs, artists can create false impressions that grossly distort differences by using these simple principles of basic geometry: When you double each side of a square, its area doesn’t merely double; it increases by a factor of four. When you double each side of a cube, its volume doesn’t merely double; it increases by a factor of eight. 2.25 Scatterplot (Two Numerical Variables) 2.26 NBA "],

In particular, we present measures of center, including mean and median. Our objective here is not only to find the value of each measure of center, but also to interpret those values. A measure of center is a value at the center or middle of a data set. 3.1 Mean (or Arithmetic Mean) The mean (or arithmetic mean) of a set of data is the measure of center found by adding all of the data values and dividing the total by the number of data values. \\[\\bar{x}=\\frac{\\sum x_i}{n}\\] Sample means drawn from the same population tend to vary less than other measures of center. The mean of a data set uses every data value. A disadvantage of the mean is that just one extreme value (outlier) can change the value of the mean substantially. (Using the following definition, we say that the mean is not resistant.) A statistic is resistant if the presence of extreme values (outliers) does not cause it to change very much. Caution: We don’t use the term average in Statistics. Instead, we use the term mean, or expected value, which will be introduced later. 3.2 Notations \\(\\sum\\) denotes the sum of a set of values. \\(x\\) is the variable usually used to represent the individual data values. \\(n\\) represents the number of data values in a sample. \\(N\\) represents the number of data values in a population. \\(\\bar{x}\\): the mean of a set of sample values (sample mean) \\(\\bar{x}=\\frac{\\sum{x}}{n}\\) \\(\\mu\\): the mean of all values in a population (population mean) \\(\\mu=\\frac{\\sum{x}}{N}\\) 3.3 Mean-Example Find the mean of the first five data speeds for Verizon: 38.5, 55.6, 22.4, 14.1, and 23.1 (all in megabits per second, or Mbps). Find the mean of the first five counts for Chips Ahoy regular cookies: 22 chips, 22 chips, 26 chips, 24 chips, and 23 chips. 3.4 Median Median is the middle value when the original data values are arranged in order of increasing (or decreasing) magnitude often denoted by \\(\\tilde{x}\\) is not affected by an extreme value - is a resistant measure of the center To find the median, first sort the values (arrange them in order) and then follow one of these two procedures: If the number of data values is odd, the median is the number located in the exact middle of the sorted list. If the number of data values is even, the median is found by computing the mean of the two middle numbers in the sorted list. 3.5 Median-Example Find the median of the first five data speeds for Verizon: 38.5, 55.6, 22.4, 14.1, and 23.1 (all in megabits per second, or Mbps). Repeat of the previous example after including the sixth data speed of 24.5 Mbps. That is, find the median of these data speeds: 38.5, 55.6, 22.4, 14.1, 23.1, 24.5 (all in Mbps). 3.6 Which one do you use? Mean or Median? 3.7 Which one do you use? Mean or Median? In a symmetrical distribution, the mean and median are equal. In a skewed distribution, the mean is pulled in the direction of the skewness. In a symmetrical distribution, you should report the mean! In a skewed distribution, the median should be reported as the measure of center! 3.8 Mode Mode is the value that occurs with the greatest frequency Data set can have one, more than one, or no mode Bimodal two data values occur with the same greatest frequency Multimodal more than two data values occur with the same greatest frequency No Mode no data value is repeated Mode is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data. 3.9 Mode-Example 3.10 Midrange Midrange is the value midway between the maximum and minimum values in the original data set \\(Midrange=\\frac{Maximum \\enspace Value +Minimum \\enspace Value}{2}\\) Because the midrange uses only the maximum and minimum values, it is very sensitive to those extremes so the midrange is not resistant. 3.11 Round-Off Rules for Measures of Center For the mean, median, and midrange, carry one more decimal place than is present in the original set of values. For the mode, leave the value as is without rounding (because values of the mode are the same as some of the original data values). 3.12 Calculating a Weighted Mean When data values are assigned different weights, \\(w\\), we can compute a weighted mean. \\[\\bar{x}=\\frac{\\sum{(w\\cdot x)}}{\\sum{w}}\\] In her first semester of college, a student of the author took five courses. Her final grades along with the number of credits for each course were A (3 credits), A (4 credits), B (3 credits), C (3 credits), and F (1 credit). The grading system assigns quality points to letter grades as follows: A = 4; B = 3; C = 2; D = 1; F = 0. 3.13 More Examples About Finding The Means Angelique made scores of 85, 56, and 91 on her first three statistic tests. What does she need to make on her next test to have an 80 test average? Mr. Plum’s math class of 25 students had an average of 85 on a test. Miss Scarlet’s class of 22 students had an average of 87 on the same test. What is the average of the two classes combined? Consider the time that it takes the faculty of AVC to drive to school. The mean and median times are calculated. Of the times, 40 minutes and 25 minutes, which is the mean and which is the median? Why? 3.14 Measures of Variation Variation is the single most important topic in statistics, so this is the single most important section in this book. This section presents three important measures of variation: range, standard deviation, and variance. These statistics are numbers, but our focus is not just computing those numbers but developing the ability to interpret and understand them. 3.15 Round-off Rule for Measures of Variation When rounding the value of a measure of variation, carry one more decimal place than is present in the original set of data. 3.16 Range The range of a set of data values is the difference between the maximum data value and the minimum data value. Range = (maximum value) - (minimum value) It is very sensitive to extreme values; therefore, it is not as useful as other measures of variation. Because the range uses only the maximum and minimum values, it does not take every value into account and therefore does not truly reflect the variation among all of the data values. Find the range of these Verizon data speeds (Mbps): 38.5, 55.6, 22.4, 14.1, 23.1. 3.17 Standard Deviation The standard deviation of a set of sample values, denoted by s, is a measure of how much data values deviate away from the mean. s: sample standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\): population standard deviation 3.18 Formula Sample standard deviation: \\[s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}\\] or \\[s=\\sqrt{\\frac{n\\sum (x_i^2)-\\sum(x_i)^2}{n(n-1)}}\\] Population standard deviation \\[\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\mu)^2}{N}}\\] 3.19 Interpretation of Standard Deviation The standard deviation is a measure of variation of all values from the mean; or a measure of how much data values deviate away from the mean. The value of the standard deviation s is never negative. It is zero only when all of the data values are exactly the same. The value of the standard deviation s can increase dramatically with the inclusion of one or more outliers (data values far away from all others). The units of the standard deviation s are the same as the units of the original data values. Larger values of \\(s\\) indicate greater amounts of variation. The sample standard deviation \\(s\\) is a biased estimator of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), which means that values of the sample standard deviation \\(s\\) do not center around the value of \\(\\sigma\\). Use sample standard deviation formula to find the standard deviation of these Verizon data speed times (in Mbps): 38.5, 55.6, 22.4, 14.1, 23.1. 3.20 Range Rule of Thumb for Understanding Standard Deviation The range rule of thumb is a crude but simple tool for understanding and interpreting standard deviation. The vast majority (such as 95%) of sample values lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Significantly low values are \\(\\mu-2\\sigma\\) or lower. (Minimum “usual” value = (mean) - 2 \\(\\times\\) (standard deviation)) Significantly high values are \\(\\mu+2\\sigma\\) or higher. (Maximum “usual” value = (mean) + 2 \\(\\times\\) (standard deviation)) Values not significant are between \\(\\mu-2\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu+2\\sigma\\). Using the 40 chocolate chip counts for the Chips Ahoy cookies, the mean is 24.0 chips and the standard deviation is 2.6 chips. Use the range rule of thumb to find the minimum and maximum “usual” numbers of chips.\\ Would a cookie with 30 chocolate chips be “unusual”? 3.21 Range Rule of Thumb for Estimating a Value of the Standard Deviation s To roughly estimate the standard deviation from a collection of known sample data use \\[s\\approx \\frac{Range}{4}\\] where range = (maximum value) - (minimum value) 3.22 Variance of a Sample and a Population The variance of a set of values is a measure of variation equal to the square of the standard deviation. Sample variance: \\(s^2\\) - Square of the sample standard deviation \\(s\\) Population variance: \\(\\sigma^2\\) - Square of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) The units of the variance are the squares of the units of the original data values. The value of the variance can increase dramatically with the inclusion of outliers. (The variance is not resistant.) The value of the variance is never negative. It is zero only when all of the data values are the same number. The sample variance \\(s^2\\) is an unbiased estimator of the population variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). 3.23 Notations \\(s\\): samle standard deviation \\(n\\): sample size \\(s^2\\): sample variance \\(\\sigma\\): population standard deviation \\(N\\): population size \\(\\sigma^2\\): population variance 3.24 The Empirical Rule IQ scores have a bell-shaped distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. What percentage of IQ scores are between 70 and 130? 3.25 Chebyshev’s Theorem 3.26 Extra Example A list has 10 numbers. Each number is a 1, 2, or 3. The average is 2 and the SD is 0. What is the list? 3.27 Measures of Relative Standing and Boxplots This section introduces measures of relative standing, which are numbers showing the location of data values relative to the other values within a data set. They can be used to compare values from different data sets, or to compare values within the same data set. The most important concept is the z score. We will also discuss percentiles and quartiles, as well as a new statistical graph called the boxplot. 3.28 z Scores z-score (or standardized value) is the number of standard deviations that a given value x is above or below the mean. z-score of a sample data value: \\(z=\\frac{x-\\bar{x}}{s}\\) z-score of a population data value: \\(z=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\) Round z scores to two decimal places 3.29 Important Properties of z Scores A z-score is the number of standard deviations that a given value x is above or below the mean. z-scores are expressed as numbers with no units of measurement. A data value is significantly low if its z-score is less than or equal to -2 or the value is significantly high if its z-score is greater than or equal to +2. If an individual data value is less than the mean, its corresponding z score is a negative number. 3.30 Examples Suppose the mean and standard deviation of a distribution are \\(\\mu=50\\) and \\(s = 5\\) If the x-value is 55, what is the z-score? If the x-value is 45, what is the z-score? If the x-value is 60, what is the z-score? So what does the z-score tell you? The author of the text measured his pulse rate to be 48 beats per minute. Is that pulse rate unusual if the mean adult male pulse rate is 67.3 beats per minute with a standard deviation of 10.3? Sally is taking two different math achievement tests with different means and standard deviations. The mean score on test A was 56 with a standard deviation of 3.5, while the mean score on test B was 65 with a standard deviation of 2.8. Sally scored a 62 on test A and a 69 on test B. On which test did Sally score the best? Why? 3.31 Percentiles Percentiles are measures of location, denoted \\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), . . . , \\(P_99\\), which divide a set of data into 100 groups with about 1% of the values in each group. The process of finding the percentile that corresponds to a particular data value x is given by the following (round the result to the nearest whole number) \\[\\textrm{Percentile of a data value x}=\\frac{\\textrm{number of values less than x}}{\\textrm{total number of values}}\\times 100\\] The airport Verizon cell phone data speeds listed below are arranged in increasing order. Find the percentile for the data speed of 11.8 Mbps. 3.32 Interpretation of Percentiles From the previous example: A data speed of 11.8 Mbps is in the 40th percentile. This can be interpreted loosely as this: A data speed of 11.8 Mbps separates the lowest 40% of values from the highest 60% of values. We have \\(P_{40} = 11.8\\) Mbps. Better interpretation: 40% of the data values are less than 11.8 Mbps or 60% of the data values are greater than 11.8 Mbps What is the percentile for the median? How would you interpret the median better? 3.33 Example from a dataset ## height ideal_ht sleep fastest ## 1 76 78 9.5 119 ## 2 74 76 7.0 110 ## 3 64 NA 9.0 85 ## 4 62 65 7.0 100 ## 5 72 72 8.0 95 ## 20% 50% 80% 90% ## 90 102 120 130 Interpet the meanings of the above perentiles About 20% of the students drove slower than 90 mph About 50% of the students drove slower than 102 mph (median!) About 80% of the students drove slower than 120 mph About 90% of the students drove slower than 130 mph 3.34 Notations n total number of values in the data set k percentile being used (Example: For the 25th percentile, k = 25.) L locator that gives the position of a value (Example: For the 12th value in the sorted list, L = 12.) \\(P_k\\) kth percentile (Example: \\(P_{25}\\) is the 25th percentile.) 3.35 Converting a Percentile to a Data Value Find L, where \\(L=\\frac{k}{100}\\times n\\) If L is not a whole number, round up to the next whole number and find the data value in that position. If L is a whole number, average the data values in position L and L+1. (Notes: You need to put the numbers in order from small to large first.) 3.36 Example Refer to the sorted data speeds below. Find the 40th and 60th percentile, denoted by \\(P_{40}\\) and \\(P_{60}\\), respectively. 3.37 Quartiles Quartiles are measures of location, denoted \\(Q_1\\), \\(Q_2\\), and \\(Q_3\\), which divide a set of data into four groups with about 25% of the values in each group \\(Q_1\\) (First quartile): Same value as \\(P_{25}\\). It separates the bottom 25% of the sorted values from the top 75%. \\(Q_2\\) (Second quartile): Same as \\(P_{50}\\) and same as the median. It separates the bottom 50% of the sorted values from the top 50%. \\(Q_3\\) (Third quartile): Same as \\(P_{75}\\). It separates the bottom 75% of the sorted values from the top 25%. Different technologies often yield different results. 3.38 Statistics defined using quartiles and percentiles Just focus on the Interquartile Range (IQR) 3.39 5-Number Summary For a set of data, the 5-number summary consists of these five values: Minimum \\(Q_1\\) \\(Q_2\\) or median \\(Q_3\\) Maximum 3.40 Example: Finding a 5-Number Summary Use the Verizon airport data speeds to find the 5-number summary. 3.41 Boxplot (or Box-and-Whisker Diagram) A boxplot (or box-and-whisker diagram) is a graph of a data set that consists of a line extending from the minimum value to the maximum value, and a box with lines drawn at the first quartile \\(Q_1\\), the median, and the third quartile \\(Q_3\\). 3.42 Procedure for Constructing a Boxplot Find the 5-number summary (minimum value, \\(Q_1\\), \\(Q_2\\), \\(Q_3\\), maximum value). Construct a line segment extending from the minimum data value to the maximum data value. Construct a box (rectangle) extending from Q1 to Q3, and draw a line in the box at the value of Q2 (median). Use the Verizon airport data speeds to construct a boxplot. 3.43 Skewness A boxplot can often be used to identify skewness. A distribution of data is skewed if it is not symmetric and extends more to one side than to the other. 3.44 Identifying Outliers for Modified Boxplots Find the quartiles \\(Q_1\\), \\(Q_2\\), and \\(Q_3\\). Find the interquartile range (IQR), where \\(\\textrm{IQR} = Q_3- Q_1\\). Evaluate \\(1.5\\times \\textrm{IQR}\\). In a modified boxplot, a data value is an outlier if it is above \\(Q_3\\), by an amount greater than \\(1.5\\times \\textrm{IQR}\\) or below \\(Q_1\\), by an amount greater than \\(1.5\\times \\textrm{IQR}\\). 3.45 Modified Boxplot 3.46 Example ## min Q1 median Q3 max mean sd n missing ## 0.8 8.4 14 21 78 18 16 50 0 ## $stats ## [1] 0.8 7.9 13.9 21.5 38.5 ## ## $n ## [1] 50 ## ## $conf ## [1] 11 17 ## ## $out ## [1] 43 56 71 78 3.47 Comparative Boxplots "],

Bernoulli: The Art of Conjecturing; Abraham de Moivre: The Doctrine of Chance 4.2 Basics of Probability Event: Any collection of results or outcomes of a procedure Simple Event: an outcome or an event that cannot be further broken down into simpler components Sample Space:for a procedure consists of all possible simple events; that is, the sample space consists of all outcomes that cannot be broken down any further 4.3 Example: Procedure Example of Events Sample Space: Complete List of Simple Events Single birth 1 girl (simple event) {b, g} 3 births 2 boys and 1 girl (bbg, bgb, and gbb are all simple events) {bbb, bbg, bgb, bgg, gbb, gbg, ggb, ggg} Not a Simple Event: With three births, the event of “2 girls and 1 boy” is not a simple event because it can occur with these different simple events: ggb, gbg, bgg. 4.4 Notation for Probabilities P: denotes a probability. A, B, and C: denote specific events. P(A): denotes the probability of event A occurring. 4.5 Probability Limits Always express a probability as a fraction or decimal number between 0 and 1. The probability of an impossible event is 0. The probability of an event that is certain to occur is 1. For any event A, the probability of A is between 0 and 1 inclusive. That is, \\(0\\leq P(A)\\leq 1\\). 4.6 Three Common Approaches to Finding the Probability of an Event Relative Frequency Approximation of Probability Conduct (or observe) a procedure and count the number of times that event A occurs. P(A) is then approximated as follows: \\[P(A)=\\frac{\\textrm{# of times A occurs}}{\\textrm{# of times the procedure repeated}}\\] Classical Approach to Probability (Requires Equally Likely Outcomes) If a procedure has n different simple events that are equally likely, and if event A can occur in s different ways, then \\[P(A)=\\frac{\\textrm{# of times A occurs}}{\\textrm{# of different simple events}}\\] Subjective Probabilities P(A), the probability of event A, is estimated by using knowledge of the relevant circumstances. Other Method: Simulations 4.7 Rounding Probabilities When expressing the value of a probability, either give the exact fraction or decimal or round off final decimal results to three significant digits. 4.8 Law of Large Numbers Law of Large Numbers: As a procedure is repeated again and again, the relative frequency probability of an event tends to approach the actual probability. The law of large numbers applies to behavior over a large number of trials, and it does not apply to any one individual outcome. If we know nothing about the likelihood of different possible outcomes, we should not assume that they are equally likely. The actual probability depends on factors such as the amount of preparation and the difficulty of the test. 4.9 Example In a recent year, there were about 3,000,000 skydiving jumps and 21 of them resulted in deaths. Find the probability of dying when making a skydiving jump We use the relative frequency approach as follows: \\[P(\\textrm{skydiving death})=\\frac{\\textrm{# of skydiving deaths}}{\\textrm{# of skyding jumps}}=\\frac{21}{3000000}\\approx 0.000007\\] In a study of U.S. high school drivers, it was found that 3785 texted while driving during the previous 30 days, and 4720 did not text while driving during that same time period (based on data from “Texting While Driving . . . ,” by Olsen, Shults, Eaton, Pediatrics, Vol. 131, No. 6). Based on these results, if a high school driver is randomly selected, find the probability that he or she texted while driving during the previous 30 days. 4.10 Complementary Events \\[\\textrm{The complement of event A, denoted by} \\bar{A} , \\textrm{consists of all outcomes in which the event A does not occur.}\\] In a recent year, there were 3,000,000 skydiving jumps and 21 of them resulted in death. Find the probability of not dying when making a skydiving jump. 4.11 Rules of Complementary Events \\[P(A)+P(\\bar{A})=1\\] \\[P(A)=1-P(\\bar{A})\\] \\[P(\\bar{A})=1-P(A)\\] 4.12 Identifying Significant Results with Probabilities The Rare Event Rule for Inferential Statistics: If, under a given assumption, the probability of a particular observed event is very small and the observed event occurs significantly less than or significantly greater than what we typically expect with that assumption, we conclude that the assumption is probably not correct. Significantly high number of successes: x successes among n trials is a significantly high number of successes if the probability of x or more successes is unlikely with a probability of 0.05 or less. That is, x is a significantly high number of successes if \\(P(\\textrm{x or more})\\leq 0.05\\). Significantly low number of successes: x successes among n trials is a significantly low number of successes if the probability of x or fewer successes is unlikely with a probability of 0.05 or less. That is, x is a significantly low number of successes if \\(P(\\textrm{x or fewer}) \\leq 0.05\\) 4.13 Probability Review The probability of an event is a fraction or decimal number between 0 and 1 inclusive. The probability of an impossible event is 0. The probability of an event that is certain to occur is 1. \\(P(A) = \\textrm{the probability of event A}\\) \\(P(\\bar{A})=\\textrm{the probability of event A doesn&#39;t occur or the complement of event A}\\) 4.14 Odds Actual Odds Against Actual Odds in Favor Payoff Odds: The payoff odds against event A occurring are the ratio of net profit (if you win) to the amount bet: \\[ \\textrm{Payoff odds against event A = (net profit):(amount bet)}\\] 4.15 Example: Actual Odds Versus Payoff Odds Find the actual odds against the outcome of 13. How much net profit would you make if you win by betting $5 on 13? If the casino was not operating for profit and the payoff odds were changed to match the actual odds against 13, how much would you win if the outcome were 13? 4.16 Super Lotto Odds: 1 in 41,416,353 Jackpot: Minimum $38 million (what is the payoff odds if you won the jackpot?) 4.17 Addition Rule and Multiplication Rule Compound Event: A compound event is any event combining two or more simple events. Notation for Addition Rule:P(A or B) = P(in a single trial, event A occurs or event B occurs or they both occur) or using math symbols: \\[\\textrm{P(A or B)}=P(A\\cup B)=\\textrm{P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)}\\] 4.18 Disjoint Events and the Addition Rule Disjoint (or mutually exclusive): Events A and B are disjoint (or mutually exclusive) if they cannot occur at the same time. (That is, disjoint events do not overlap.) Example: Event A-Randomly selecting someone for a clinical trial who is a male; Event B-Randomly selecting someone for a clinical trial who is a female (The selected person cannot be both.) Events that are not disjoint: Event A-Randomly selecting someone taking a statistics course; Event B-Randomly selecting someone who is a female (The selected person can be both.) 4.19 Summary To find P(A or B), first associate the word or with addition. To find the value of P(A or B), if you the events are not mutually exclusive, you need to subtract the probability of event A and B both occur (P( A and B)) 4.20 Rule of Complementary Events \\[P(A)+P(\\bar{A})=1\\] \\[P(A)=1-P(\\bar{A})\\] \\[P(\\bar{A})=1-P(A)\\] 4.21 Example Based on a journal article, the probability of randomly selecting someone who has sleepwalked is 0.292, so P(sleepwalked) = 0.292 (based on data from “Prevalence and Comorbidity of Nocturnal Wandering in the U.S. General Population,” by Ohayon et al., Neurology, Vol. 78, No. 20). If a person is randomly selected, find the probability of getting someone who has not sleepwalked. Musical styles other than rock and pop are becoming more popular. A survey of college students finds that the probability they like country music is .40. The probability that they liked jazz is .30 and that they liked both is .10. What is the probability that they like country or jazz? 4.22 Multiplication Rule P(A and B) = P(event A occurs in a first trial and event B occurs in a second trial) P(B | A) represents the probability of event B occurring after it is assumed that event A has already occurred. This is also called conditional probability. To find the probability that event A occurs in one trial and event B occurs in another trial, multiply the probability of event A by the probability of event B, but be sure that the probability of event B is found by assuming that event A has already occurred. \\[\\textrm{If two events A &amp; B are dependent}, P(\\textrm{A and B})=P(A \\cap B)=P(A)\\cdot P(B|A)\\] \\[\\textrm{If two events A &amp; B are independent}, P(\\textrm{A and B})=P(A \\cap B)=P(A)\\cdot P(B) \\] 4.23 Independence and the Multiplication Rule Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other. (Several events are independent if the occurrence of any does not affect the probabilities of the occurrence of the others.) If A and B are not independent, they are said to be dependent. A certain brand of light bulbs are defective five percent of the time. You randomly pick a package of two such bulbs off the shelf of a store. What is the probability that both bulbs are defective? Can you assume they are independent? There are seven girls and eight boys in a math class. The teacher selects two students at random to answer questions on the board. What is the probability that both students are girls? Are these events independent? Suppose 50 drug test results are given from people who use drugs: If 2 of these 50 subjects are randomly selected with replacement, find the probability the first selected person had a positive test result and the second selected person had a negative test result. Repeat part (a) by assuming that the two subjects are selected without replacement. Positive Test Results 44 Negative Test Results 6 Total Test Results 50 When two different people are randomly selected from those in your class, find the indicated probability by assuming birthdays occur on the same day of the week with equal frequencies. Probability that two people are born on the same day of the week. Probability that two people are both born on Monday. 4.24 Sampling In the world of statistics, sampling methods are critically important, and the following relationships hold: - Sampling with replacement: Selections are independent events. - Sampling without replacement: Selections are dependent events. - When sampling without replacement and the sample size is no more than 5% of the size of the population, treat the selections as being independent (even though they are actually dependent). - Assume that three adults are randomly selected without replacement from the 247,436,830 adults in the United States. Also assume that 10% of adults in the United States use drugs. Find the probability that the three selected adults all use drugs. 4.25 Redundancy: Important Application of the Multiplication Rule The principle of redundancy is used to increase the reliability of many systems. Our eyes have passive redundancy in the sense that if one of them fails, we continue to see. An important finding of modern biology is that genes in an organism can often work in place of each other. Engineers often design redundant components so that the whole system will not fail because of the failure of a single component Modern aircraft are now highly reliable, and one design feature contributing to that reliability is the use of redundancy, whereby critical components are duplicated so that if one fails, the other will work. For example, the Airbus 310 twin-engine airliner has three independent hydraulic systems, so if any one system fails, full flight control is maintained with another functioning system. we will assume that for a typical flight, the probability of a hydraulic system failure is 0.002. If the Airbus 310 were to have one hydraulic system, what is the probability that the aircraft’s flight control would work for a flight? Given that the Airbus 310 actually has three independent hydraulic systems, what is the probability that on a typical flight, control can be maintained with a working hydraulic system? 4.26 Combining the addition and multiplication rules &amp; Tree Diagrams The tree diagram summarizes the possible outcomes for a true/false question followed by a multiple choice question. Note that there are 10 possible combinations. A certain brand of light bulbs are defective five percent of the time. You randomly pick a package of two such bulbs off the shelf of a store. What is the probability that exactly one bulb is defective? Box 1 contains 2 red balls and 1 blue ball. Box 2 contains 3 blue balls and 1 red ball. A coin is tossed. If it falls heads up, box 1 is selected and a ball is drawn. If it falls tails up, box 2 is selected and a ball is drawn. Find the probability of selecting a red ball. 4.27 More Examples An urn contains 3 red marbles, 4 blue marbles and 6 green marbles. A marble is selected and its color noted. Then it is replaced. A second marble is selected and its color noted. Find the probability of Selecting 2 red marbles Selecting 1 red marble and then 1 blue marble Selecting 1 blue marble then 1 green marble Draw three cards from a deck of cards and not replaced. Find the probability of these events: Getting 3 jacks Getting an ace, a King, and a queen in order getting a club, a spade and a heart in order. 4.28 Summary of Addition Rule and Multiplication Rule Addition Rule for P(A or B): The word or suggests addition, and when adding P(A) and P(B), we must add in such a way that every outcome is counted only once. Multiplication Rule for P(A and B): The word and for two trials suggests multiplication, and when multiplying P(A) and P(B), we must be sure that the probability of event B takes into account the previous occurrence of event A. 4.29 Complements and Conditional Probability When finding the probability of some event occurring “at least once,” we should understand the following: “At least one” has the same meaning as “one or more.” The complement of getting “at least one” particular event is that you get no occurrences of that event. 4.30 The Probability of “At Least One” The probability that at least one outcome happens is 1 minus the probability that no outcomes happen. P(at least 1) = 1 - P(none) A certain brand of light bulbs are defective five percent of the time. You randomly pick a package of two such bulbs off the shelf of a store. What is the probability that at least one bulb is defective? A study by SquareTrade found that 6% of damaged iPads were damaged by “bags/backpacks.” If 20 damaged iPads are randomly selected, find the probability of getting at least one that was damaged in a bag/backpack. Is the probability high enough so that we can be reasonably sure of getting at least one iPad damaged in a bag/backpack? For a sales promotion the manufacturer places winning symbols under the caps of 10% of all Dr. Pepper bottles. You buy a six-pack. What is the probability that you win something? 4.31 Conditional Probability A conditional probability of an event is a probability obtained with the additional information that some other event has already occurred. P(A | B) denotes the conditional probability of event A occurring, given that event B has already occurred. \\[P(A|B)=\\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}\\] 4.32 Example: If one test subject is randomly selected, find the probability that the subject had a positive test result, given that the subject actually uses drugs. That is, find P(positive test result | subject uses drugs). If one test subjects is randomly selected, find the probability that the subject actually uses drugs, given that he or she had a positive test result. That is, find P(subject uses drugs | positive test result). A recent survey asked 100 people if they thought women in the armed forces should be permitted to participate in combat. The results of the survey are shown Find the probability of the respondent answered yes, given that the respondent was a female Find the probability of the respondent was a male, given that the respondent answered no. Gender Yes No Total Male 32 18 50 Female 8 42 50 Total 40 60 100 In a recent study it was found that the probability that a randomly selected student is a girl is .51 and is a girl and plays sports is .10. If the student is female, what is the probability that she plays sports?

Use what you have learned in this chapter to help answer the following questions about the district’s drug-testing program. Show your method clearly. What’s the probability that a randomly chosen athlete tests positive for banned substances? If two athletes are randomly selected, what’s the probability that at least one of them tests positive? If a randomly chosen athlete tests positive, what’s the probability that the student did not take a banned substance?

Give consideration to distinguishing between outcomes that are likely to occur by chance and outcomes that are “unusual” in the sense they are not likely to occur by chance. Random Variable: A random variable is a variable (typically represented by x) that has a single numerical value, determined by chance, for each outcome of a procedure. Probability Distribution: A probability distribution is a description that gives the probability for each value of the random variable. It is often expressed in the format of a table, formula, or graph. Discrete Random Variable: A discrete random variable has a collection of values that is finite or countable. (If there are infinitely many values, the number of values is countable if it is possible to count them individually, such as the number of tosses of a coin before getting heads.) Continuous Random Variable: A continuous random variable has infinitely many values, and the collection of values is not countable. (That is, it is impossible to count the individual items because at least some of them are on a continuous scale, such as body temperatures.) 5.1 Probability Distribution Requirements There is a numerical (not categorical) random variable x, and its number values are associated with corresponding probabilities. For every possible x value. \\[0\\leq P(x)\\leq 1\\] For all values of x, \\[\\sum P(x)=1\\] 5.2 Example Suppose you toss 3 coins &amp; record the number of heads. The random variable X defined as: \\[\\textrm{Let x}=\\# \\textrm{of heads}\\] Create a probability distribution: x 0 1 2 3 P(x) .125 .37 .375 .125 We can draw a probability histogram based on the pdf (Probability Density Function): We can also find the cumulative sum ## [1] 0.12 0.50 0.88 1.00 Which means \\(P(x\\leq 2)=P(x=0)+P(x=1)+P(x=2)=0.875\\), \\(p(x\\leq3)=P(x=0)+P(x=1)+P(x=2)+P(x=3)=1\\) Graph it: 0 means P(x less than or equal to 0) or P(x is equal to 0) 1 means P(x less than or equal to 1), which is P(x=0)+P(x=1)=0.125+0.345=0.5 5.3 Example Let x be the number of courses for which a randomly selected student at a certain university is registered.

The mean, variance, and standard deviation of a discrete probability distribution can be found with the following formulas: Expected value (or mean) and the standard deviation of discrete random variables. The expected value of X is the value of X that we would expect to see if we repeated the experiment many times. We can also call it as the “mean” \\[\\mu=E(X)=\\sum x\\cdot P(X)\\] Multiply every value in the range of X by it’s corresponding probability, then sum these products. The standard deviation of X is a measure of how much X is expected to differ from E(X). \\[\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\sum (x-\\mu)^2\\cdot P(X)}\\] Find the difference between every value in the range of X and E(X). Square the differences. Multiply the squares by the corresponding probability. Sum the products. Take the square root. The variance is the square of the standard deviation, so \\[Var(X)=(x-\\mu)^2\\cdot P(X)\\] 5.5 Example Let x be the number of courses for which a randomly selected student at a certain university is registered.

(success/failure) There are a fixed number of trials Outcomes of different trials are independent The probability that a trial results in success is the same for all trials The binomial random variable x is defined as the number of successes out of the fixed number Notation: \\[X\\sim \\textrm{Bin(n,p)}\\] Are these binomial distributions?

Suppose that we want to find the probability that exactly three of five randomly selected adults know what Twitter is. Does this procedure result in a binomial distribution? If this procedure does result in a binomial distribution, identify the values of n, x, p, and q.

What is the probability of Peter getting between 80 and 81 on the test? 6.16 Finding Values From Known Areas Graphs are extremely helpful in visualizing, understanding, and successfully working with normal provability distributions, so they should always be used. Don’t confuse z scores and areas.z scores are distances along the horizontal scale, but areas are regions under the normal curve. Table A-2 lists z scores in the left columns and across the top row, but areas are found in the body of the table. Choose the correct (right/left) side of the graph. A value separating the top 10% from the others will be located on the right side of the graph, but a value separating the bottom 10% will be located on the left side of the graph. A z score must be negative whenever it is located in the left half of the normal distribution. Areas (or probabilities) are always between 0 and 1, and they are never negative. 6.17 Examples The lifetime of a certain type of battery is normally distributed with a mean of 200 hours and a standard deviation of 15 hours. How long must a battery last to be in the top 5%? When designing equipment, one common criterion is to use a design that accommodates 95% of the population.

Scores of each of the previous French tests were normally distributed with a mean of 74 and standard deviation of 2.7. Julie will be taking the test tomorrow. What is the probability of Julie getting at most 70 on the test? 6.19 Sampling Distributions and Estimators We now consider the concept of a sampling distribution of a statistic. Instead of working with values from the original population, we want to focus on the values of statistics (such as sample proportions or sample means) obtained from the population. The sampling distribution of a statistic is the distribution of values taken by the statistic in all possible samples of the same size from the same population. The sampling distribution of a statistic (such as the sample mean or sample proportion) is the distribution of all values of the statistic when all possible samples of the same size n are taken from the same population. (The sampling distribution of a statistic is typically represented as a probability distribution in the format of a table, probability histogram, or formula.) 6.20 General Behavior of Sampling Distributions When samples of the same size are taken from the same population, the following two properties apply: Sample proportions tend to be normally distributed. The mean of sample proportions is the same as the population mean. \\(p=\\) population proportion; \\(\\hat{p}=\\) Sample Proportion. Example: 6.21 Estimator A statistic used to estimate a parameter is unbiased if the mean of its sampling distribution is equal to the true value of the parameter being estimated. Unbiased Estimator: An unbiased estimator is a statistic that targets the value of the corresponding population parameter in the sense that the sampling distribution of the statistic has a mean that is equal to the corresponding population parameter. For example: \\(\\bar{x}\\), \\(\\hat{p}\\), and \\(s^2\\) Biased Estimator: They do not target the value of the corresponding population parameter. For example: median, range, and \\(s\\) 6.22 Why Sample with Replacement? Sampling is conducted with replacement because of these two very important reasons: When selecting a relatively small sample from a large population, it makes no significant difference whether we sample with replacement or without replacement. Sampling with replacement results in independent events that are unaffected by previous outcomes, and independent events are easier to analyze and result in simpler calculations and formulas. 6.23 Central Limit Theorem When n is sufficiently large, the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) is well approximated by a normal curve, even when the population distribution is not itself normal. CLT can safely be applied if n exceeds 30. \\[\\bar{x}\\sim N(\\mu,\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}})\\] Which means the mean of the sample mean is the same as the population mean, but the standard deviation (or Standard Error) of the sample mean is the population standard deviation divided by the squart root of the sample size. Sampling Distribution of the Mean 6.24 Practical Rules for Real Applications Involving a Sample Mean x-bar Requirements: Population has a normal distribution or \\(n&gt;30\\): mean of the sample means: \\(\\mu_{\\bar{x}}=\\mu\\) standard deviation (standard error) of the sample means: \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) \\(z\\) score conversion: \\(\\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\) Original population is not normally distributed and \\(n\\leq 30\\): use other methods 6.25 Considerations for Practical Problem Solving Check Requirements: When working with the mean from a sample, verify that the normal distribution can be used by confirming that the original population has a normal distribution or the sample size is \\(n&gt;30\\). Individual Value or Mean from a Sample? 6.26 Examples The elevator in the car rental building at San Francisco International Airport has a placard stating that the maximum capacity is “4000 lb - 27 passengers.” This converts to a mean passenger weight of 148 lb when the elevator is full. We will assume a worst-case scenario in which the elevator is filled with 27 adult males. Assume that adult males have weights that are normally distributed with a mean of 189 lb and a standard deviation of 39 lb. Find the probability that 1 randomly selected adult male has a weight greater than 148 lb. Find the probability that a sample of 27 randomly selected adult males has a mean weight greater than 148 lb.

For example: \\(\\hat{p}\\) and \\(\\bar{x}\\) Simplest approach But not always very precise due to variation in the sampling distribution The sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the best point estimate of the population p because it is a unbiased estimator of \\(p\\). Example: A Gallup poll was taken in which 1487 adults were surveyed and 43% of them said that they have a Facebook page. Based on that result, find the best point estimate of the proportion of all adults who have a Facebook page. 7.2 Confidence Intervals A confidence interval (or interval estimate) is a range (or an interval) of values used to estimate the true value of a population parameter. confidence interval is sometimes abbreviated as CI. Are used to estimate the unknown population parameters (population mean, population proportion, or population standard deviation etc.) Any value fall within the confidence interval is a possible true parameter. (population proportion or population mean) Formula: \\[\\textrm{point estimate}\\pm \\textrm{margin of error}\\] 7.3 Confidence level The confidence level is the probability \\(1-\\alpha\\) (such as 0.95, or 95%) that the confidence interval actually does contain the population parameter, assuming that the estimation process is repeated a large number of times. (The confidence level is also called the degree of confidence, or the confidence coefficient.) Is the success rate of the method used to construct the interval Using this method, ____% of the time the intervals constructed will contain the true population parameter A confidence level is the probability \\(1-\\alpha\\) (often expressed as the equivalent percentage value) that the confidence interval actually does contain the population parameter, assuming that the estimation process is repeated a large number of times. Most common choices are 90%, \\((\\alpha=0.1)\\), 95%, \\((\\alpha=0.05)\\), or 99%, \\((\\alpha=0.01)\\). 7.4 Margin of Error Shows how accurate we believe our estimate is The smaller the margin of error, the more precise our estimate of the true parameter Formula: \\[\\textrm{M. E}=\\textrm{critical value}\\cdot \\textrm{standard error of the statistic}\\] 7.5 Critical value \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) Found from the confidence level A standard z score can be used to distinguish between sample statistics that are likely to occur and those that are unlikely to occur. Such a z score is called a critical value. The upper z-score with probability p lying to its right under the standard normal curve Common Critical values: confidence level \\(\\alpha\\) \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) 90% 0.1 1.645 95% 0.05 1.96 99% 0.01 2.575 7.6 Margin of Error for Proportions The margin of error E is also called the maximum error of the estimate and can be found by multiplying the critical value and the standard deviation of the sample proportions: \\[E=z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\] 7.7 Confidence Interval for Estimating a Population Proportion p p: population proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\): sample proportion, or the point estimate \\(\\hat{q}=1-\\hat{p}\\) n: number of sample values E: margin of error \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\): z score separating an area of \\(\\alpha/2\\) in the right tail of the standard normal distribution; our critical value 7.8 Steps for doing a confidence interval: Assumptions Calculate the interval (Round the confidence interval limits for p to three significant digits) Write a statement about the interval in the context of the problem. 7.9 Assumptions for confidence interval of proportion SRS of context normal distribution check: \\(n\\hat{p}\\geq 10\\) and \\(n(1-\\hat{p})\\geq 10\\) Large population size: population size is at least 10n 7.10 Calculation Confidence interval for a population proportion: \\(\\hat{P}\\pm E\\) or \\((\\hat{p}-E, \\hat{p}+E)\\) \\[C.I.=\\hat{p}\\pm z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\] 7.11 Confidence Interval Mantra (Conclusion): We are ___ % confident that the true ___ lies between __.\" Example: We are 99% confident that the true proportion of orange Reese’s Pieces lies between 0.38 and 0.50. 7.12 Example We noted that a Gallup poll of 1487 randomly selected adults showed that 43% of the respondents have Facebook pages. Check assumptions Find the margin of error E that corresponds to a 95% confidence level. Find the 95% confidence interval estimate of the population proportion p. Interpret the confidence interval. Based on the results, can we safely conclude that fewer than 50% of adults have Facebook pages? Assuming that you are a newspaper reporter, write a brief statement that accurately describes the results and includes all of the relevant information. Here is one statement that summarizes the results: 43% of adults have Facebook pages. That percentage is based on a Gallup poll of 1487 randomly selected adults in the United States. In theory, in 95% of such polls, the percentage should differ by no more than 2.5 percentage points in either direction from the percentage that would be found by interviewing all adults. 7.13 Analyzing Polls When analyzing results from polls, consider the following: The sample should be a simple random sample, not an inappropriate sample. The confidence level should be provided. The sample size should be provided. Except for relatively rare cases, the quality of the poll results depends on the sampling method and the size of the sample, but the size of the population is usually not a factor. Never think that poll results are unreliable if the sample size is a small percentage of the population size. The population size is usually not a factor in determining the reliability of a poll. 7.14 Example A May 2000 Gallup Poll found that 38% of a random sample of 1012 adults said that they believe in ghosts. Find a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of adults who believe in ghosts. Do a complete write-up.

(Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 274, No. 17) includes this statement: “Of the 71 subjects, 70% were abstinent from smoking at 8 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 58% to 81%).” Use that statement to find the point estimate \\(\\hat{p}\\)^ and the margin of error E. 7.16 Determining Sample Size: Finding the Sample Size Required to Estimate a Population Proportion When \\(\\hat{p}\\) is known: \\[n=\\frac{[z_{\\alpha/2}]^2 \\hat{p}\\hat{q}}{E^2}\\] When \\(\\hat{p}\\) is unknown: \\[n=\\frac{[z_{\\alpha/2}]^2 0.25}{E^2}\\] Many companies are interested in knowing the percentage of adults who buy clothing online. How many adults must be surveyed in order to be 95% confident that the sample percentage is in error by no more than three percentage points? Use a recent result from the Census Bureau: 66% of adults buy clothing online. Assume that we have no prior information suggesting a possible value of the proportion. When the author was conducting research for this chapter, he could find no information about the percentage of adults who make online purchases, yet that information is extremely important to online stores as well as brick and mortar stores. If the author were to conduct his own survey, how many adults must be surveyed in order to be 95% confident that the sample percentage is in error by no more than three percentage points? Assume that a recent poll showed that 80% of adults make online purchases. Assume that we have no prior information suggesting a possible value of the population proportion. 7.17 Estimating a Population Mean Point Estimate: \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the point estimate of \\(\\mu\\) Use sample data to construct and interpret a confidence interval estimate of true value of a population mean \\(\\mu\\) Find the sample size 7.18 Student’s t- distribution Developed by William Gosset Continuous distribution Unimodal, symmetrical, bell-shaped density curve Above the horizontal axis Area under the curve equals 1 Based on degrees of freedom 7.19 Formula: \\[\\textrm{point estimate}\\pm \\textrm{margin of error}\\] In our case: \\[\\bar{x}\\pm t_{\\alpha/2}\\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] Where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean, \\(t_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the critical t value with degress of freedom n-1, \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size. 7.20 How to find the critical t value 7.21 Steps for doing a confidence interval for population mean ( steps are the same as confidence interval for proportion): Assumptions Calculate the interval Write a statement about the interval in the context of the problem. 7.22 Assumptions: Have an SRS from population (or randomly assigned treatments) \\(\\sigma\\) unknown Normal (or approx. normal) distribution Given Large sample size (\\(n&gt;30\\)) Check graph of data 7.23 Example A common claim is that garlic lowers cholesterol levels. In a test of the effectiveness of garlic, 49 subjects were treated with doses of raw garlic, and their cholesterol levels were measured before and after the treatment. The changes in their levels of LDL cholesterol (in mg/dL) have a mean of 0.4 and a standard deviation of 21.0. Use the sample statistics of \\(n = 49\\), \\(\\bar{x} = 0.4\\), and \\(s = 21.0\\) to construct a 95% confidence interval estimate of the mean net change in LDL cholesterol after the garlic treatment. (Do a complete write up). What does the confidence interval suggest about the effectiveness of garlic in reducing LDL cholesterol? 7.24 Example A medical researcher measured the pulse rate of a random sample of 20 adults and found a mean pulse rate of 72.69 beats per minute with a standard deviation of 3.86 beats per minute.

A researcher is interested in estimating the mean blood alcohol content of people arrested for driving under the influence. Based on past data, the researcher assumes a population standard deviation of 0.065. What sample size is needed to estimate the true mean blood alcohol content within .005 units at the 95% confidence level? 7.26 Dealing with Unknown \\(\\sigma\\) When Finding Sample Size Use the range rule of thumb to estimate the standard deviation as follows: \\(\\sigma=range/4\\), where the range is determined from sample data. Start the sample collection process without knowing \\(\\sigma\\) and, using the first several values, calculate the sample standard deviation s and use it in place of \\(\\sigma\\). The estimated value of ?? can then be improved as more sample data are obtained, and the sample size can be refined accordingly. Estimate the value of ?? by using the results of some other earlier study. 7.27 Using real data Consumer Reports tested 14 randomly selected brands of vanilla yogurt and found the following numbers of calories per serving: 160 200 220 230 120 180 140 130 170 190 80 120 100 170 Compute a 98% confidence interval for the average calorie content per serving of vanilla yogurt.

A hypothesis test is a procedure for testing a claim about a property of a population. Rare Event Rule for Inferential Statistics–If, under a given assumption, the probability of a particular observed event is exceptionally small, we conclude that the assumption is probably not correct. The null hypothesis (denoted by \\(H_{0}\\)) is a statement that the value of a population parameter (such as proportion, mean, or standard deviation) is equal to some claimed value. We test the null hypothesis directly in the sense that we assume it is true and reach a conclusion to either reject \\(H_{0}\\) or fail to reject \\(H_{0}\\). The alternative hypothesis (denoted by \\(H_{A}\\)) is the statement that the parameter has a value that somehow differs from the null hypothesis. The symbolic form of the alternative hypothesis must use one of these symbols: &lt;, &gt;, \\(\\neq\\). If you are conducting a study and want to use a hypothesis test to support your claim, the claim must be worded so that it becomes the alternative hypothesis. Example: murder trial. How does a murder trial work? First, assume that the person is innocent. Then, must have sufficient evidence to prove guilty 8.2 Steps Assumptions Hypothesis statements &amp; define parameters Calculations Conclusion, in context 8.3 Assumptions (Same as the confidence intervals’) Assumptions for testing for proportions (Same as confidence intervals for proportions) SRS Normal Distribution np&gt;10 and n(1-p)&gt;10 Large population size. Assumptions for testing for the means SRS of context \\(\\sigma\\) unknown Normal distribution. (Given; \\(n\\geq 30\\); Graphs) 8.4 Writing Hypothesis statements: Null hypothesis - is the statement being tested; this is a statement of “no effect” or “no difference” (\\(H_{0}\\)); is a statement that the value of a population parameter (such as proportion, mean, or standard deviation) is equal to some claimed value. We test the null hypothesis directly in the sense that we assume it is true and reach a conclusion to either reject \\(H_0\\) or fail to reject \\(H_0\\) \\[H_{0}:\\textbf{parameter = hypothesized value}\\] - Alternative hypothesis - is the statement that we suspect is true (\\(H_{A}\\)); is a statement that the parameter has a value that somehow differs from the null hypothesis. \\[H_{A}: \\textbf{parameter &gt; hypothesized value}(\\textrm{right-tailed test})\\] \\[H_{A}: \\textbf{parameter &lt; hypothesized value}(\\textrm{left-tailed test})\\] \\[H_{A}: \\textbf{parameter} \\neq \\textbf{hypothesized value}(\\textrm{two-tailed test})\\] Always refer to populations; use symbols which represent the parameters like \\(p\\), and \\(\\mu\\). (We don’t test values from samples). 8.5 Identify the Correct Hypothesis Statements. 8.6 Significance Level \\(\\alpha\\) Significance Level: The significance level \\(\\alpha\\) for a hypothesis test is the probability value used as the cutoff for determining when the sample evidence constitutes significant evidence against the null hypothesis. By its nature, the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is the probability of mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true: Significance level \\(\\alpha=\\textrm{P(rejecting } H_0 \\textrm{ when } H_0 \\textrm{ is true)}\\) Common choices for \\(\\alpha\\) are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10; 0.05 is most common. 8.7 Test Statistic The test statistic is a value used in making a decision about the null hypothesis, and is found by converting the sample statistic to a score with the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Common formula: \\[\\textbf{Test Statistic}=\\frac{\\textbf{statistic-parameter}}{\\textbf{SE of statistic}}\\] Parameter Sampling Distribution Assumptions Test Statistic Proportion \\(p\\) \\(\\hat{p}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(p, \\sqrt{\\frac{pq}{n}})\\) SRS;Normal Distribution: np&gt;10 and n(1-p)&gt;10; large population size \\(\\displaystyle{z=\\frac{\\hat{p}-p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{pq}{n}}}}\\) Mean \\(\\mu\\) \\(t\\) distribution SRS; \\(\\sigma\\) unknown; Normal distribution.

(Given; \\(n\\geq 30\\); Graphs) \\(\\displaystyle{z=\\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}}\\) 8.8 Critical Region The critical region (or rejection region) is the area corresponding to all values of the test statistic that cause us to reject the null hypothesis. The area of the critical region (rejection region) is equal to \\(\\alpha\\). (i.e. Find the critical values from chapter 7) If the test staticstic falls inside the rejection region, then we reject the \\(H_0\\); otherwise, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\). 8.9 P-Value Method (Easier to understand) In a hypothesis test, the P-value is the probability of getting a value of the test statistic that is at least as extreme as the test statistic obtained from the sample data in the direction specified by \\(H_A\\), assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Small P-values are evidence against \\(H_0\\) because they say the the observed result is unlikely to occur when \\(H_0\\) is true. Large P-values fail to give convincing evidence against \\(H_0\\) and in favor of \\(H_A\\) because they say the the observed result is likely to occur by chance alone when \\(H_0\\) is ture. Double the p-value for two-tail (=) tests (“things have changed”) Never accept the null hypothesis! 8.10 Calculating P-values (By hand) Draw &amp; shade a curve &amp; calculate the p-value. z values are the test statistics. right-tail test (Greater than) z = 1.6; p-value=0.0548 left-tail test (less than) z = -2.4; P-value = .0082 two-tail test (not equal to) z = 2.3; P-value = (.0107)2 = .0214 8.11 Statistical Significant The p-value is as small or smaller than the level of significance, \\(\\alpha\\) If \\(p-value&gt;\\alpha\\), “fail to reject” the null hypothesis at the \\(\\alpha\\) level. If \\(p-value \\leq \\alpha\\), “reject” the null hypothesis at the \\(\\alpha\\) level. (Statistical Significant) 8.12 Example: At \\(\\alpha=0.05\\), would you accept, recejct, or fail to reject the null hypothesis? 0.03 0.15 0.45 0.023 8.13 Writing Conclusions: A statement of the decision being made (reject or fail to reject \\(H_{0}\\)) &amp; why (linkage) A statement of the results in context. (state in terms of \\(H_{A}\\)) 8.14 Conclusion Format: Since the p-value &lt; (&gt;) \\(\\alpha\\), I reject (fail to reject) the \\(H_{0}\\). There is (is not) sufficient evidence to suggest that \\(H_{A}\\).(Be sure to write \\(H_{A}\\) in context (words)!) 8.15 Examples: 1009 consumers were asked if they are comfortable with having drones deliver their purchases, and 54% (or 545) of them responded with “no.” Use these results to test the claim that most consumers are uncomfortable with drone deliveries. We interpret “most” to mean “more than half” or “greater than 0.5.” (Do a Complete write-up) A study of sleepwalking or “nocturnal wandering” was described in Neurology magazine, and it included information that 29.2% of 19,136 American adults have sleepwalked.

Let denote the proportion of 2-year-olds than have this understanding in the home situation, and suppose that p = .35. The investigators wish to determine whether the proportion that remembers is less when the child is away from home.

(Do a Complete write-up) 8.16 Errors When you perform a hypothesis test you make a decision: reject \\(H_{0}\\) or fail to reject \\(H_{0}\\). When you make one of these decisions, there is a possibility that you could be wrong! That you made an error! There are two decisions that we make; reject or fail to reject. Each could possibly be a wrong decision; therefore, there are two types of errors. Type I error When you reject the null hypothesis that is really true Denoted by \\(\\alpha\\) Is the level of significance of the test Type II error When you fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false Denoted by \\(\\beta\\) \\(H_{0} True\\) \\(H_{0} False\\) Reject \\(H_{0}\\) Type I Good Fail to reject \\(H_{0}\\) Good Type II 8.17 Example Lay’s Chip Company decides to accept a truckload of potatoes based upon results from a sample of potatoes from the truckload. What are the hypotheses? Type I error? Type II error? From the supplier’s viewpoint, which is more serious? From the chip company’s viewpoint, which is more serious? Assume that we are conducting a hypothesis test of the claim that a method of gender selection increases the likelihood of a baby girl, so that the probability of a baby girls is p &gt; 0.5. Here are the null and alternative hypotheses: \\[p=0.5\\\\p&gt;0.5\\] + Identify a type I error. + Identify a type II error. 8.18 Controlling Type I and Type II Errors For any fixed \\(\\alpha\\), an increase in the sample size n will cause a decrease in \\(\\beta\\)??? For any fixed sample size n, a decrease in \\(\\alpha\\) will cause an increase in \\(\\beta\\). Conversely, an increase in \\(\\alpha\\) will cause a decrease in \\(\\beta\\). To decrease both \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), increase the sample size. 8.19 Power of a Hypothesis The power of a hypothesis test is the probability \\(1-\\beta\\) of rejecting a false null hypothesis. The value of the power is computed by using a particular significance level \\(\\alpha\\) and a particular value of the population parameter that is an alternative to the value assumed true in the null hypothesis. 8.20 Testing a Claim About a Mean Assumptions for t-test: (same as CI for the means) Have an SRS of context \\(\\sigma\\) unknown Distribution is approximately normal Given Large sample size (CLT, n&gt;30) Graph data (for smaller sample sizes) Hypothesis Statement: Use the notation \\(\\mu\\) Calculation The test statistic is \\[t=\\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\\] Or simply use the P-value method. Conclusion Same format as before. 8.21 Example The Wall Street Journal (January 27, 1994) reported that based on sales in a chain of Midwestern grocery stores, President’s Choice Chocolate Chip Cookies were selling at a mean rate of $1323 per week. Suppose a random sample of 30 weeks in 1995 in the same stores showed that the cookies were selling at the average rate of $1208 with standard deviation of $275. Does this indicate that the sales of the cookies is different from the earlier figure?

Fritzi suspects that some producers are adding water to their milk to increase their profits. Excess water can be detected by determining the freezing point of milk. The freezing temperature of natural milk varies normally, with a mean of -0.545 degrees and a standard deviation of 0.008. Added water raises the freezing temperature toward 0 degrees, the freezing point of water (in Celsius). The laboratory manager measures the freezing temperature of five randomly selected lots of milk from one producer with a mean of -0.538 degrees with standard deviation 0.008.

For example, Researchers investigated the reliability of test assessment. On group consisted of 30 students who took proctored tests. A second group consisted of 32 students who took online tests without a proctor. The two samples are independent, because the subjects were not matched or paired in any way. Dependent: Two samples are dependent (or consist of matched pairs) if the sample values are somehow matched, where the matching is based on some inherent relationship. For example: Students of the author collected data consisting of the heights (cm) of husbands and the heights (cm) of their wives. Five of those pairs are listed below. The data are dependent, because each height of each husband is matched with the height of his wife. 9.13 Notations For population 1, we have \\(\\mu_1\\): populaiton mean from population 1 \\(\\bar{x}_1\\): sample mean from sample 1 \\(n_1\\): sample size from sample 1 \\(s_1\\): sample standard deviation from sample 1 \\(\\sigma_1\\): population standard deviation from population 1 the corresponing notations apply to \\(\\mu_2\\), \\(n_2\\), \\(\\bar{x}_2\\), \\(s_2\\), and \\(\\sigma_2\\) from population 2. 9.14 Assumptions: Have two SRS’s from the populations or two randomly assigned treatment groups Samples are independent Both distributions are approximately normally Have large sample sizes (both sample sizes are greater than 30) Graph BOTH sets of data \\(\\sigma&#39;s\\) unknown. 9.15 Calculation for Confidence Interval \\[(\\bar{x_1}-\\bar{x_2})\\pm t_{\\alpha/2}\\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}\\] Degrees of freedom: 9.16 Interpretation We are 95% confident that the true difference in mean … lies between … 9.17 Example Two competing headache remedies claim to give fast-acting relief.

The pairs must be matched according to some relationship, such as before/after measurements from the same subjects or IQ scores of husbands and wives. 9.21 Good Experimental Design When designing an experiment or planning an observational study, using dependent samples with matched pairs is generally better than using two independent samples. One form Pair individuals by certain characteristics Randomly select treatment for individual A Individual B is assigned to other treatment Assignment of B is dependent on assignment of A Second form Individual persons or items receive both treatments Order of treatments are randomly assigned or before &amp; after measurements are taken The two measures are dependent on the individual 9.22 Assumptions Same as two-sample t test, but they are denpendent. 9.23 Calculation for Confidence Interval Find the differece of the matched data points, then construct a one sample t-interval.

A linear correlation exists between two variables when there is a correlation and the plotted points of paired data result in a pattern that can be approximated by a straight line. 10.2 Interpreting Scatterplots Distinct straight-line, or linear, pattern. We say that there is a positive linear correlation between x and y, since as the x values increase, the corresponding y values also increase. Distinct straight-line, or linear pattern. We say that there is a negative linear correlation between x and y, since as the x values increase, the corresponding y values decrease. No distinct pattern, which suggests that there is no correlation between x and y. Distinct pattern suggesting a correlation between x and y, but the pattern is not that of a straight line. 10.3 Identify as having a positive association, a negative association, or no association.

Visual examination of the scatterplot must confirm that the points approximate a straight-line pattern. The outliers must be removed if they are known to be errors. The effects of any other outliers should be considered by calculating r with and without the outliers included. 10.5 Properties of \\(r\\) legitimate values of r is \\(-1\\leq r\\leq 1\\) Strong positive correlation: \\(0.8\\leq r\\leq 1\\) Strong negative correlation: \\(-1\\leq r\\leq -0.8\\) Moderate positive correlation: \\(0.5\\leq r\\leq 0.8\\) Moderate negative correlation: \\(-0.8\\leq r\\leq -0.5\\) Weak positive correlation: \\(0&lt; r\\leq 0.5\\) Weak negative correlation: \\(-0.5&lt; r&lt; 0\\) No correlation: \\(r\\approx 0\\) If all values of either variable are converted to a different scale, the value of r does not change The value of r is not affected by the choice of x and y. Interchange all x- and y-values and the value of r will not change. r measures strength of a linear relationship. r is very sensitive to outliers, which can dramatically affect the value of r. 10.6 Interpretation of r There is a direction, strength, type of association/relationship/correlation) between x and y. 10.7 Example Speed Limit(mph) 55 50 45 40 30 20 Avg. # of accidents(per week) 28 25 21 17 11 6 Calculate r.

Format: Approximately _% of variation in Y can be explained by the linear relationship (linear model) between X and Y. 10.11 Correlation does not imply causation!!!!!!!!! 10.12 Linear Regression for Bivariate Data Regression Line: Given a collection of paired sample data, the regression line (or line of best fit, or least-squares line) is the straight line that “best” fits the scatterplot of the data. Regression Equation: \\[\\hat{y}=b_0+b_1x\\] x variable: is the independent or explanatory variable y variable: is the dependent or response variable \\(b_0\\): y-intercept of the line. \\(b_1\\) slope of the line. You need to interpret \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) in context, no just y-intercept and slope. Use x to predict y \\(\\hat{y}\\): predicted y value Some textbooks simply use \\(\\hat{y}=a+bx\\) 10.13 Finding the Equation of the Regression Line: Notation for the Equation of a Regression Line 10.14 Finding the Equation of the Regression Line: Requirements The sample of paired (x, y) data is a random sample of quantitative data. Visual examination of the scatterplot shows that the points approximate a straight-line pattern.* Outliers can have a strong effect on the regression equation, so remove any outliers if they are known to be errors. Consider the effects of any outliers that are not known errors. For each fixed value of x, the corresponding values of y have a normal distribution. For the different fixed values of x, the distributions of the corresponding y-values all have the same standard deviation. (This is violated if part of the scatterplot shows points very close to the regression line while another portion of the scatterplot shows points that are much farther away from the regression line.) For the different fixed values of x, the distributions of the corresponding y values have means that lie along the same straight line. 10.15 Least Squares Regression Line: LSRL The line that gives the best fit to the data set The line that minimizes the sum of the squares of the deviations from the line (\\(y-\\hat{y}\\)) \\(\\hat{y}=b_0+b_1x\\), where \\(b_1\\) is the slope and \\(b_1=r\\frac{s_y}{s_x}\\); \\(b_0\\) is the y-intercept and \\(b_0=\\bar{y}-b_1\\bar{x}\\) 10.16 Interpretations of Variables Define x and \\(\\hat{y}\\) Slope(\\(b_1\\)): For each unit increase in x, there is an approximate increase/decrease of b in y. y-intercept (\\(b_0)\\): The value of y when \\(x=0\\). Write it in context. Correlation coefficient (r): There is a direction, strength, linear of association between x and y. Coefficient of Determination (\\(r^2\\)): Approximately _% of variation in Y can be explained by the linear relationship (linear model) between X and Y. 10.17 Example The ages (in months) and heights (in inches) of seven children are given. x 16 24 42 60 75 102 120 y 24 30 35 40 48 56 60 Find the LSRL.

Predict the height of a child who is 4.5 years old. Predict the height of someone who is 20 years old. 10.18 Extrapolation The LSRL should not be used to predict y for values of x outside the data set. It is unknown whether the pattern observed in the scatterplot continues outside this range. 10.19 Practice Use the data set before Chocolate Consumption: 4.5, 10.2, 4.4, 2.9, 3.9, 0.7, 8.5, 7.3, 6.3, 11.6, 2.5, 8.8, 3.7, 1.8, 4.5, 9.4, 3.6, 2, 3.6, 6.4, 11.9, 9.7, 5.3 numbers of Nobel Laureates: 5.5, 24.3, 8.6, 0.1, 6.1, 0.1, 25.3, 7.6, 9, 12.7, 1.9, 12.7, 3.3, 1.5, 11.4, 25.5, 3.1, 1.9, 1.7, 31.9, 31.5, 18.9, 10.8 Find the LSRL.

Predict the number of Nobel Laureates when the amount of chcolate consumption are 5.5 10.20 Making Predictions Good Model: Use the regression equation for predictions only if the graph of the regression line on the scatterplot confirms that the regression line fits the points reasonably well. Bad Model: If the regression equation does not appear to be useful for making predictions, don’t use the regression equation for making predictions. For bad models, the best predicted value of a variable is simply its sample mean. Good Models: Check scatter plots, \\(r\\), \\(r^2\\), \\(p-value\\), or residual plots. 10.21 Outlier Outlier: In a scatterplot, an outlier is a point lying far away from the other data points. Influential Points: Paired sample data may include one or more influential points, which are points that strongly affect the graph of the regression line. 10.22 Residuals (error) The vertical deviation between the observations &amp; the LSRL the sum of the residuals is always zero error = observed - expected \\[residual = y-\\hat{y}\\] 10.23 Resudual Plot A scatterplot of the (x, residual) pairs.

(If there are outliers, consider their effects by comparing results that include the outliers to results that exclude the outliers.) Construct a residual plot and verify that there is no pattern (other than a straight-line pattern) and also verify that the residual plot does not become thicker (or thinner).

Consider any effects of a pattern over time. 10.26 Explained and Unexplained Variation Assume that we have a sample of paired data having the following properties There is sufficient evidence to support the claim of a linear correlation between x and y. 10.27 Coefficient of Determination The coefficient of determination is the proportion of the variation in y that is explained by the regression line.

What can I do? 11.2 Chi-Squared Test (\\(\\chi^2\\)) Used to test the counts of categorical data Three Types Goodness of fit (univariate) Independence (bivariate) Homogeneity (univerate with two samples) 11.3 \\(\\chi^2\\) Distribution Different df have different curves Skewd to the right As df increases, curve shifts toward right and becomes more like a normal curve. 11.4 \\(\\chi^2\\) Assumptions SRS All expected counts are greater than or equal to 5 Observations are mutually exclusive and independent. 11.5 Hypothesis Statetment: Write in Context \\[H_0: \\textrm{The frequency counts agree with the claimed distribution}\\\\ H_A: \\textrm{The frequency counts do not agree with the claimed distribution. } \\] Or use math symbols: \\[H_{0}: p_1=p_2\\cdots=p_n\\\\H_A: \\textrm{At least one proportion is different from the others}\\] ## \\(\\chi^2\\) formula \\[\\chi^2=\\sum\\frac{(Observed-Expected)^2}{Expected}\\] or \\[\\chi^2=\\sum\\frac{(O-E)^2}{E}\\] 11.6 First Case: \\(\\chi^2\\) Goodness-of-Fit Test Uses univariate data Want to see how well the observed counts fit what we expect the counts to be. df=number of categories-1 Same procedures as hypothesis testings 11.7 How do we find the expected counts If categories have the same proportion, use \\(E=\\frac{n}{k}\\), where n is the total counts, and k is the number of categories. If categories have different proportions, use \\(E=np\\), where n is the total counts, and p is the proportion for each category. 11.8 Example Does your zodiac sign determine how successful you will be? Fortune magazine collected the zodiac signs of 256 heads of the largest 400 companies. Is there sufficient evidence to claim that successful people are more likely to be born under some signs than others? Counts Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius Pisces Observed 23 20 18 23 18 21 19 22 20 19 24 29 Expected How many would you expect in each sign if there were no difference between them? How many degrees of freedom? Assumptions SRS All expected counts \\(\\geq 5\\) The number of CEO’s born under each zodiac sign is mutually exculsive and independent Hypothesis Statement \\[H_0: \\text{The number of CEO&#39;s born under each sign is the same}\\\\H_A:\\text{The number of CEO&#39;s born under each sign is different} \\] Calculation: Traditional Way: \\[ \\chi^2=\\sum\\frac{(O-E)^2}{E}=\\frac{(23-21.3)^2}{21.3}+\\frac{(20-21.3)^2}{21.3}+\\cdots +\\frac{(29-21.3)^2}{21.3}=5.094\\] Use the p-value method( Always use the right-tail test) ## Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer Leo Virgo ## 23 20 18 23 18 21 ## Libra Scorpio Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius Pisces ## 19 22 20 19 24 29 ## Chi-squared test for given probabilities ## ## Observed counts Expected by Null Contr to chisq stat ## Aries 23 21.3 0.13 ## Taurus 20 21.3 0.08 ## Gemini 18 21.3 0.52 ## Cancer 23 21.3 0.13 ## Leo 18 21.3 0.52 ## Virgo 21 21.3 0.01 ## Libra 19 21.3 0.26 ## Scorpio 22 21.3 0.02 ## Sagittarius 20 21.3 0.08 ## Capricorn 19 21.3 0.26 ## Aquarius 24 21.3 0.33 ## Pisces 29 21.3 2.76 ## ## ## Chi-Square Statistic = 5.09 ## Degrees of Freedom of the table = 11 ## P-Value = 0.926 Conclusion Since p-value&gt;\\(\\alpha\\), I fail to reject to \\(H_0\\). There is not sufficient evidence to suggest that the number of CEO’s born under each sign is different. 11.9 Example A company says its premium mixture of nuts contains 10% Brazil nuts, 20% cashews, 20% almonds, 10% hazelnuts and 40% peanuts. You buy a large can and separate the nuts. Upon weighing them, you find there are 112 g Brazil nuts, 183 g of cashews, 207 g of almonds, 71 g or hazelnuts, and 446 g of peanuts. You wonder whether your mix is significantly different from what the company advertises? Why is the chi-square goodness-of-fit test NOT appropriate here? 11.10 Example Offspring of certain fruit flies may have yellow or ebony bodies and normal wings or short wings. Genetic theory predicts that these traits will appear in the ratio 9:3:3:1(yellow &amp; normal, yellow &amp; short, ebony &amp; normal, ebony &amp; short) A researcher checks 100 such flies and finds the distribution of traits to be 59, 20, 11, and 10, respectively. What are the expected counts? df? Are the results consistent with the theoretical distribution predicted by the genetic model? 11.11 Example According to Benford’s law, many data sets have the property that the leading (first) digits follow the distribution shown in the first two rows of the table below. The bottom row lists the frequencies of leading digits of Internet traffic inter-arrival times. Do the frequencies in the bottom row fit the distribution according to Benford’s Law? 11.12 Contingency Table Contingency Table: A contingency table (or two-way frequency table) is a table consisting of frequency counts of categorical data corresponding to two different variables. (One variable is used to categorize rows, and a second variable is used to categorize columns.) Test of Independence: In a test of independence, we test the null hypothesis that in a contingency table, the row and column variables are independent. (That is, there is no dependency between the row variable and the column variable.) 11.13 \\(\\chi^2\\) test for independence Used with categorical, bivariate data from ONE sample Used to see if the two categorical variables are associated (dependent) or not associated (independent). Assumptions &amp; formula remain the same! Hypothesis Statement - written in words \\[H_0:\\text{Two variables are independent}\\\\ H_A:\\text{Two variables are dependent}\\] Be sure to write in context! 11.14 Example A beef distributor wishes to determine whether there is a relationship between geographic region and cut of meat preferred. If there is no relationship, we will say that beef preference is independent of geographic region. Suppose that, in a random sample of 500 customers, 300 are from the North and 200 from the South. Also, 150 prefer cut A, 275 prefer cut B, and 75 prefer cut C. Based on the information, we can make a table like this: North South Total Cut A 90 60 150 Cut B 165 110 275 Cut C 45 30 75 Total 300 200 500 Find the expected counts. Better Way to find the Extected Counts \\[E=\\frac{\\text{row total}\\cdot \\text{column total}}{\\text{grand total}}\\] Degrees of freedom \\[df=(r-1)(c-1)\\] Where r is the number rows, c is the number of column. Ignore the row for the total and the column for the total. Or cover up one row and one column then count the number of cells remaining! 11.15 Example: Continued Suppose the observe vaules for the question above is below: North South Total Cut A 100 50 150 Cut B 150 125 275 Cut A 50 25 75 Total 300 200 500 Is there sufficient evidence to suggest that geographic regions and beef preference are not independent?

There is sufficient evidence to suggest that geographic regions and beef preference are not independent. 11.16 Example 11.17 \\(\\chi^2\\) Test of Homogenity A \\(\\chi^2\\) test of homogeneity is a test of the claim that different populations have the same proportions of some characteristics. Assumptions &amp; formula remain the same! Expected counts &amp; df are found the same way as test for independence. Only change is the hypotheses! Hypothesis Statement - written in words \\[H_0:\\text{The distributions are the same}\\\\ H_A:\\text{The distributions are different}\\] Be sure to write in context! 11.18 Example The following data is on drinking behavior for independently chosen random samples of male and female students. Does there appear to be a gender difference with respect to drinking behavior? (Note: low = 1-7 drinks/wk, moderate = 8-24 drinks/wk, high = 25 or more drinks/wk) Men Women None 140 186 Low 478 661 Moderate 300 173 High 63 16 Assumptions SRS All expected \\(\\geq 5\\) Hypothesis Statement \\[H_0: \\text{Ther is no gender difference with respect to drinking behavior}\\\\ H_A: \\text{There is gender difference with respect to drinking behavior} \\] Calculation ## Men Women ## None 140 186 ## Low 478 661 ## Moderate 300 173 ## High 63 16 ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## Observed Counts: ## Men Women ## None 140 186 ## Low 478 661 ## Moderate 300 173 ## High 63 16 ## ## Counts Expected by Null: ## Men Women ## None 158.6 167.4 ## Low 554.0 585.0 ## Moderate 230.1 242.9 ## High 38.4 40.6 ## ## Contributions to the chi-square statistic: ## Men Women ## None 2.17 2.06 ## Low 10.42 9.87 ## Moderate 21.27 20.14 ## High 15.72 14.89 ## ## ## Chi-Square Statistic = 96.5 ## Degrees of Freedom of the table = 3 ## P-Value = 0 Conclusion Since p-value&lt;\\(\\alpha\\), I reject \\(H_0\\).
